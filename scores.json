{"\n\n    Easter Term\n[2015] UKSC 31\nOn appeal from: [2013] EWCA Civ 1465\nJUDGMENT\nStarbucks (HK) Limited and another (Appellants) v\nBritish Sky Broadcasting Group PLC and others\n(Respondents)\nbefore\nLord Neuberger, President\nLord Sumption\nLord Carnwath\nLord Toulson\nLord Hodge\nJUDGMENT GIVEN ON\n13 May 2015\nHeard on 25 and 26 March 2015\nAppellants Respondents\nMichael Silverleaf QC Geoffrey Hobbs QC\nKathryn Pickard Iain Purvis QC\nGuy Hollingworth\n(Instructed by Dechert\nLLP\n)\n(Instructed by King and\nWood Mallesons LLP\n)\nPage 2\nLORD NEUBERGER: (with whom Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwath, Lord\nToulson and Lord Hodge agree)\n1. This appeal raises the issue whether, as the appellants contend, a claimant\nwho is seeking to maintain an action in passing off need only establish a reputation\namong a significant section of the public within the jurisdiction, or whether, as the\ncourts below held, such a claimant must also establish a business with customers\nwithin the jurisdiction. It is an issue on which there is conflicting jurisprudence in\nthe common law world, and it is of particularly acute significance in the age of global\nelectronic communication.\nThe factual background\n2. The claim in these proceedings relates to internet protocol television\n(\u201cIPTV\u201d), which is a way of delivering TV or video content over the internet. There\nare two main types of IPTV, \u201cclosed circuit\u201d and \u201cover the top\u201d. Closed circuit IPTV\nuses dedicated bandwidth on the provider\u2019s network. It requires the subscriber to\nhave a set top box to receive the service, the signal for which is encrypted. In many\nrespects, closed circuit IPTV services are akin to traditional cable broadcasts.\nHowever, in addition to linear television broadcasts, IPTV services typically include\ncatch-up facilities and other forms of video-on-demand. Over the top (\u201cOTT\u201d) IPTV\ninvolves the signal being delivered via a standard broadband connection. OTT IPTV\ncan be viewed (with appropriate software applications) on any device with a\nbroadband connection.\n3. The appellant claimants, Starbucks (HK) Ltd and PCCW Media Ltd, are\nmembers of a substantial group based in Hong Kong headed by PCCW Ltd, and I\nwill refer to group members compendiously as \u201cPCCM\u201d. Since 2003, PCCM has\nprovided a closed circuit IPTV service in Hong Kong. The service was launched\nunder the name NOW BROADBAND TV, but in March 2006 the name was\nchanged to NOW TV, under which it has operated ever since. By 2012, after PCCM\nhad spent substantial sums on marketing, NOW TV had become the largest pay TV\noperator in Hong Kong, with around 1.2m subscribers, covering over half the\nhouseholds in Hong Kong. Having started with 23 channels it now has around 200,\nand many of the programmes are PCCM\u2019s, quite a few of them under brand names\nusing the word NOW. Although the name of the channel has always been English,\nall PCCM\u2019s programmes are in Mandarin or Cantonese, but the channel also carries\nsome English language programmes (including Sky News and Manchester United\u2019s\nchannel, MUTV). Ninety per cent of PCCM\u2019s pay TV revenue comes from\nsubscriptions, the balance coming from advertising.\nPage 3\n4. People in the United Kingdom cannot receive PCCM's closed circuit service.\nNo set top boxes for it have been supplied in the UK, no subscription has been\nregistered to a subscriber with a UK billing address, and there is no evidence of any\nsubscriptions having been paid for with credit or debit cards with billing addresses\nin the UK. Consistently with this, PCCM has never held an Ofcom licence for\nbroadcasting in the UK. However, a number of Chinese speakers permanently or\ntemporarily resident in the UK in 2012 were aware of the NOW TV service through\nexposure to it when residing in or visiting Hong Kong.\n5. On the findings made by the trial judge, UK residents could also become\nacquainted with the NOW TV service in three other ways by 2012. First, since July\n2007, the Chinese language content had been accessible free of charge via PCCM\u2019s\nown websites. Secondly, programmes and trailers from the NOW TV service had\nbeen available free of charge on PCCM\u2019s \u201cchannel\u201d on the YouTube website.\nThirdly, a few of PCCM\u2019s programmes from its NOW TV service had been\navailable as videos-on-demand on various international airlines, three of which flew\ninto the UK, but none of whose in-flight magazines made reference to NOW TV.\n6. PCCM had been giving consideration to expanding its NOW TV subscription\nservice internationally, including into the UK, since some time in 2009, when it\nbegan discussions with a potential UK partner, and those discussions had been\ncontinuing during 2012. In June 2012, PCCM had launched a NOW player \u201capp\u201d in\nthe UK, both on its website and via the Apple App Store, in order to warm up the\nmarket for the launch of PCCM\u2019s NOW TV on the platform of its proposed UK\npartner. The app and the channels were to be targeted at the Chinese-speaking\npopulation in the UK. By October 2012, just over 2,200 people in the UK had\ndownloaded the app.\n7. Meanwhile, on 21 March 2012, the three respondent defendants, British Sky\nBroadcasting Group PLC, British Sky Broadcasting Ltd and Sky IP International\nLtd, who are all part of the British Sky Broadcasting Group, and have been referred\nto throughout these proceedings as \u201cSky\u201d, announced that they intended to launch a\nnew IPTV service under the name NOW TV, as an OTT service. They subsequently\neffected that launch in beta form in mid-July 2012.\n8. The development of Sky\u2019s NOW TV service had begun with a presentation\nto their operating executives in late March 2011, and, after consulting an external\nbranding organisation, Sky chose the name \u201cSky Movies NOW\u201d in September 2011.\nHowever, further consideration suggested that it would be unwise to include the\nword \u201cSky\u201d in the name of the new service, and a consumer research agency was\ninstructed to address the naming issue. The agency recommended simply using the\nword \u201cNow\u201d, and Sky decided to follow that advice, while including the phrase\n\u201cPowered by Sky\u201d in the branding.\nPage 4\nThe instant proceedings\n9. On 19 April 2012, PCCM began these proceedings, seeking to prevent Sky\nfrom using the name NOW TV in connection with its OTT IPTV service in the UK,\non the grounds that the use of that name amounted to passing off. (There was also a\nclaim that it infringed a trade mark registered in the name of PCCM. That claim was\ndismissed by the courts below and is not pursued in this appeal.)\n10. The claim came before Arnold J, and in the course of his judgment, he found\nthat a substantial number of Chinese speakers permanently or temporarily resident\nin the UK were acquainted with PCCM\u2019s NOW TV service through exposure to it\nwhen residing in or visiting Hong Kong. He also found that PCCM\u2019s NOW TV\nservice had acquired a reputation amongst members of the Chinese-speaking\ncommunity in the UK, based on their exposure to it via PCCM\u2019s NOW TV\n\u201cchannel\u201d on the YouTube website and PCCM\u2019s NOW TV websites (together \u201cthe\nwebsites\u201d) as well as the showing of PCCM\u2019s programmes on international flights.\nArnold J held that this reputation was modest but more than de minimis.\n11. However, Arnold J dismissed PCCM\u2019s claim. He rejected the argument that\nit was sufficient for PCCM to identify a body of people in the UK who associated\nthe mark NOW TV with its IPTV service in Hong Kong: they were not customers\nin the UK, and therefore did not represent goodwill in the jurisdiction. He also\nconsidered that the mere accessibility of PCCM\u2019s material in the UK via the\nwebsites did not give rise to a protectable goodwill, stating that \u201cthe key question is\nwhether the viewers of PCCM\u2019s programmes in the [UK] were customers for its\nservice so as to give rise to a protectable goodwill in the UK\u201d - [2012] EWHC 3074\nCh, [2013] FSR 29, para 147. Two paragraphs later, he said that the contention that\nviewers in the UK of PCCM\u2019s programmes on the websites represented goodwill\nwould, as he put it, stretch the concept of \u201ccustomer\u201d to breaking point. As he\nexplained, if it were otherwise, hundreds of television channels worldwide would\nhave customers, and hence protectable goodwill, in the UK, as a result of the\nYouTube website. In para 150 of his judgment, he concluded that the reality was\nthat \u201cPCCM's primary purpose in making programme content available via\nYouTube, its own websites and international airlines was to promote its Hong Kong\nbusiness by encouraging people to subscribe in Hong Kong\u201d. Therefore, he held that\nPCCM\u2019s \u201ccustomers were its viewers in Hong Kong, but not viewers in the UK\u201d,\nand so its \u201cbusiness had goodwill in Hong Kong but not in the UK\u201d, so that the\npassing off claim failed.\n12. Arnold J nonetheless added in para 158 that, if he had found PCCM to have\na protectable goodwill in the UK, he would have accepted that there was a likelihood\nthat a substantial number of UK viewers who were previously familiar with PCCM\u2019s\nNOW TV would wrongly believe that Sky\u2019s NOW TV emanated from the same or\nPage 5\na connected source. Arnold J gave PCCM permission to appeal against his decision\non the passing off claim.\n13. PCCM\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed for reasons given by\nSir John Mummery, with whom Patten and Pitchford LJJ agreed \u2013 [2013] EWCA\nCiv 1465, [2014] FSR 20. The Court of Appeal essentially agreed with Arnold J\u2019s\nanalysis as briefly summarised in para 11 above. In the circumstances, they did not\nneed to deal with the issues raised in Sky\u2019s respondent\u2019s notice, in which it was\ncontended that Arnold J had erred in finding that (i) the reputation of PCCM's NOW\nservice in the UK was more than de minimis, and (ii) internet users visiting PCCM\u2019s\nwebsite could access any video content from the UK at any relevant time.\n14. With the permission of this Court, PCCM now appeals against the decision\nof the Court of Appeal, upholding Arnold J\u2019s dismissal of its passing off claim.\nThe issue on this appeal\n15. As Lord Oliver of Aylmerton explained in Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v\nBorden Inc [1990] 1 WLR 491, \u201c[t]he law of passing off can be summarised in one\nshort general proposition \u2013 no man may pass off his goods as those of another\u201d. As\nhe immediately went on to say, a claimant, or a plaintiff as it was then, has to\nestablish three elements in order to succeed in a passing off action:\n\u201cFirst, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods\nor services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by\nassociation with the identifying \u2018get-up\u2019 (whether it consists simply of\na brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of\nlabelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services\nare offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognised by the\npublic as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff\u2019s goods or services.\nSecondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant\nto the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the\npublic to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods\nor services of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the\nplaintiff\u2019s identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or\nservices is immaterial, as long as they are identified with a particular\nsource which is in fact the plaintiff. \u2026 Thirdly, he must demonstrate\nthat he suffers or \u2026 that he is likely to suffer, damage by reason of the\nerroneous belief engendered by the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation that\nthe source of the defendant\u2019s goods or services is the same as the\nsource of those offered by the plaintiff.\u201d\nPage 6\n16. It is common ground that, in order to succeed, a claimant in a passing off\naction has to establish its claim as at the inception of the use complained of.\nAlthough there is no decision of the House of Lords specifically to that effect, it is\nsupported by a number of Court of Appeal decisions, perhaps most clearly from\nAnheuser-Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar NP [1984] FSR 413, 462, and it appears\nto me that it must be right. Accordingly, as the Judge accepted, PCCM had to\nestablish the three elements (or, on one view of PCCM\u2019s case on the first element,\nan updated version of the three elements) identified by Lord Oliver, in relation to\nthe NOW TV mark for IPTV services as at 21 March 2012, the date when Sky went\npublic about its imminent intention to launch its IPTV service in the UK under the\nname NOW TV.\n17. Subject to the issues raised by Sky in their respondent\u2019s notice, and based on\nthe conclusions reached by the Judge, PCCM established the second and third of the\nthree elements identified by Lord Oliver. The argument on this appeal has therefore\nfocussed on the first element, namely the requirement that PCCM must establish\nwhat Lord Oliver referred to as \u201ca goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or\nservices which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association\u201d with\nthe relevant \u201cget-up\u201d, viz. the mark NOW TV with PCCM\u2019s IPTV service. The\nJudge and the Court of Appeal thought that it was not enough for PCCM to establish\nthat it had a reputation among a significant number of people in this country, if it\nhad no goodwill in this country. Thus, they considered that the fact that there were\npeople in this country who associated NOW TV with PCCM\u2019s product would not\nsatisfy the first element, if those people were not or had not been customers for\nPCCM\u2019s product in this country. They also considered that the fact that people in\nthis country had been exposed to PCCM\u2019s NOW TV products via the websites and\nthe showing of PCCM\u2019s programmes on international flights did not make them\ncustomers for the purpose of establishing goodwill in this country. On behalf of Sky,\nMr Hobbs QC, who appeared with Mr Purvis QC and Mr Hollingworth, supported\nthese conclusions.\n18. Mr Silverleaf QC, who appeared with Ms Pickard for PCCM, argued that the\ncourts below were wrong, and in particular that (i) it was sufficient for PCCM to\nsucceed in its passing off claim that it had established a reputation for the NOW TV\nname in connection with its IPTV service among a significant number of people in\nthis country, even if they were not customers of PCCM\u2019s IPTV services in this\ncountry, but in Hong Kong, and (ii) in any event, PCCM had customers in this\ncountry, because a significant number of people were PCCM\u2019s customers in this\ncountry by virtue of having been exposed to PCCM\u2019s programmes on the websites\nand on international flights.\nPage 7\nThe House of Lords and Privy Council authorities and Anheuser-Busch\n19. In the course of their excellent arguments, each counsel referred to a number\nof judgments to support their respective cases. A degree of caution is appropriate\nwhen considering these earlier cases, for two reasons. First, in many (but not all) of\nthe cases, the precise issue which this appeal raises was not being considered, and\ntherefore the judges may not have had that issue in the forefront of their minds or\nhave received full argument in connection with it. Secondly, (despite certifying in\nits notice of appeal that PCCM would not be inviting this Court to depart from any\ndecision of the House of Lords) Mr Silverleaf argued that we should, if necessary,\ndevelop the law so that it accords with their case: thus, it would not automatically\nbe enough to conclude that the reasoning in a previous decision of the House of\nLords effectively disposes of this appeal.\n20. Nonetheless, it does appear that the courts in the United Kingdom have\nconsistently held that it is necessary for a claimant to have goodwill, in the sense of\na customer base, in this jurisdiction, before it can satisfy the first element identified\nby Lord Oliver. That this has been the consistent theme in the cases can be well\nestablished by reference to a series of House of Lords decisions, and a decision of\nthe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, over the past century.\n21. In AG Spalding & Bros v AW Gamage Ltd (1915) 32 RPC 273, 284, Lord\nParker of Waddington said that \u201cthe nature of the right the invasion of which is the\nsubject of [a] passing-off action\u201d was \u201ca right of property \u2026 in the business or\ngoodwill likely to be injured by the misrepresentation\u201d, and, at least unless the\nconcept of goodwill is given a significantly wider meaning than that which it\nnaturally has, it would not extend to a mere reputation. Thus, in Inland Revenue\nCommissioners v Muller & Co\u2019s Margarine Ltd [1901] AC 217, 235, Lord Lindley\nexplained that goodwill \u201cis inseparable from the business to which it adds value,\nand, in my opinion, exists where the business is carried on\u201d. As he went on to\nexplain, goodwill can have \u201ca distinct locality\u201d even within a particular jurisdiction.\nObservations of Lord Macnaghten, Lord James of Hereford and Lord Brampton at\npp 224, 228 and 231-233 respectively were to much the same effect. Although the\nobservations were made in the context of a revenue case, they purported to be\ngeneral statements about the meaning of \u201cgoodwill\u201d.\n22. In T Oertli AG v EJ Bowman (London) Ltd [1959] RPC 1, the House of Lords\nunanimously upheld a decision of the Court of Appeal, where Jenkins LJ had said\nthat it was \u201cof course essential to the success of any claim in respect of passing-off\nbased on the use of a given mark or get-up that the plaintiff should be able to show\nthat the disputed mark or get-up has become by user in this country distinctive of\nthe plaintiff\u2019s goods\u201d \u2013 see at [1957] RPC 388, 397.\nPage 8\n23. In another passing off case, Star Industrial Co Ltd v Yap Kwee Kor [1976]\nFSR 256, 269, Lord Diplock, giving the advice of the Privy Council, referred to and\nrelied on the observations of Lord Parker in Spalding. Lord Diplock explained that\n\u201c[g]oodwill, as the subject of proprietary rights, is incapable of subsisting by itself\u201d,\nhaving \u201cno independent existence apart from the business to which it is attached\u201d.\nHe went on to explain that it \u201cis local in character and divisible\u201d, so that \u201cif the\nbusiness is carried on in several countries a separate goodwill attaches to it in each\u201d.\n24. In Erven Warnink BV v J Townend & Sons (Hull) Ltd [1979] AC 731, 752,\nLord Fraser of Tullybelton quoted Lord Diplock\u2019s observations in Star Industrial\nwith approval. At pp 755-756, he went on to identify five \u201cfacts\u201d which it was\n\u201cessential\u201d for a plaintiff to establish in a passing off action, of which the first was\nthat \u201chis business consists of, or includes, selling in England a class of goods to\nwhich a particular trade name applies\u201d. In the same case, Lord Diplock at p 742,\nciting Spalding, identified \u201cfive characteristics which must be present in order to\ncreate a valid cause of action for passing off\u201d, which included \u201ccaus[ing] actual\ndamage to a business or goodwill of the [plaintiff]\u201d. Viscount Dilhorne, Lord\nSalmon and Lord Scarman agreed with both speeches.\n25. In the passage in his speech in Reckitt & Colman, quoted in para 15 above,\nLord Oliver referred to \u201ca goodwill or reputation \u2026 in the mind of the purchasing\npublic\u201d, and at p 510, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle referred to a requirement that\n\u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s goods have acquired a reputation in the market and are known by\nsome distinguishing feature\u201d. Lord Bridge of Harwich (with \u201cundisguised\nreluctance\u201d, albeit not in connection with the point at issue), Lord Brandon of\nOakbrook and Lord Goff of Chieveley agreed with both speeches.\n26. The ratio of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Anheuser-Busch was\nindisputably that, in order to support a passing off claim, the claimant must establish\ngoodwill in the form of customers for its goods or services within the jurisdiction.\nIn that case the importation from the United States of bottled beer under the\nplaintiff\u2019s BUDWEISER mark for use and sale in US military and diplomatic\nestablishments within the UK and other European countries did not entitle the\nplaintiff to establish what Lord Oliver later stated was the first element of a passing\noff claim in relation to the UK, at any rate outside those establishments. Oliver LJ\n(later of course Lord Oliver) said at p 470 that the sales of 5,000,000 cases of bottles\nover 12 years in US diplomatic and military establishments in European countries\nwere \u201csales for a very special market having no connection with the market in the\ncountries in which the consumption actually took place\u201d; having said that, he\naccepted that there could well be \u201ca localised goodwill\u201d within the diplomatic and\nmilitary establishments. He also emphasised that the fact that the BUDWEISER\nmark may have had a reputation among a significant number of people in the UK\ndid not assist the plaintiff as it involved \u201cconfus[ing] goodwill, which cannot exist\nin a vacuum, with mere reputation\u201d, adding that \u201creputation which may, no doubt,\nPage 9\nand frequently does, exist without any supporting local business, \u2026 does not by\nitself constitute a property which the law protects\u201d. O\u2019Connor and Dillon LJJ\nexpressed similar views at pp 471-472 and 476 respectively.\nPCCM\u2019s case\n27. PCCM contends that, particularly in an age of global electronic\ncommunication and relatively quick and cheap travel, it is inconsistent with\ncommercial reality and unrealistic in terms of practicality to treat the \u201creputation or\ngoodwill\u201d associated with a mark for a particular product or service as limited to\njurisdictions in which there is a business with customers for the product or service,\nand incapable of extending to jurisdictions in which the mark is simply associated\nwith the particular product or service as a matter of reputation. More specifically,\nPCCM argues that, in any event, on the facts found by Arnold J, it had a sufficient\n\u201cgoodwill or reputation\u201d \u201cin the mind of the purchasing public [in the United\nKingdom] by association with the identifying \u2018get-up\u2019\u201d of NOW TV \u201cattached to its\nproducts and services\u201d, namely its IPTV service, to satisfy the first element, as\nidentified by Lord Oliver, of its passing off claim.\n28. On behalf of PCCM, Mr Silverleaf contended that the notion that goodwill\nshould be limited to jurisdictions where the claimant had business is wrong in\nprinciple: the question of where the claimant had goodwill was a matter of fact and\nevidence, not a matter of law. Further, in the present age of \u201cinternational travel and\nthe presence of the internet\u201d, he argued that it would be anachronistic and unjust if\nthere was no right to bring passing off proceedings, particularly in relation to an\nelectronically communicated service, in a jurisdiction where, as a matter of fact, the\nplaintiff\u2019s mark had acquired a reputation. He suggested that the mere fact that the\ncustomers are in Hong Kong when they enjoy the service should not undermine\nPCCM\u2019s case that they have such a reputation here which deserves to be protected.\nHe also submitted that the law would be arbitrary if PCCM had no right to bring\npassing off proceedings despite having a reputation in this country simply because\nusers did not pay when they viewed PCCM\u2019s programmes free on the websites.\n29. Mr Silverleaf contrasted what he suggested was the slight difference between\nthe present case and cases such as Sheraton Corporation of America v Sheraton\nMotels Ltd [1964] RPC 202. In that case, Buckley J held that a United States hotel\ncompany had a sufficiently arguable case for saying that it had goodwill in the UK\nto justify an interlocutory injunction against use of its mark; the goodwill was based\non the fact that customers living in the United Kingdom booked rooms in the\nplaintiff\u2019s hotels through the plaintiff\u2019s London office or through UK-based travel\nagents.\nPage 10\n30. So far as authorities are concerned, Mr Silverleaf suggested that there was no\ndecision of the House of Lords which was inconsistent with this analysis, and, if we\nconcluded that there was, we should depart from it. He accepted that some of the\nreasoning of the Privy Council in Star Industrial and the decision and reasoning of\nthe Court of Appeal in Anheuser-Busch were inconsistent with PCCM\u2019s argument,\nbut rightly said that we were not bound by them. He also relied on some decisions\nof the English courts to which I have not so far referred, some decisions of courts in\nother common law jurisdictions, and the economic and practical realities of the early\n21st century.\n31. Lord Diplock\u2019s suggestion in Star Industrial that, if business is carried on in\nmore than one country there is a separate goodwill in each country, has been\nquestioned in more than one domestic case. Thus, in two first instance decisions,\nGraham J suggested that the geographical boundaries of any goodwill should be a\nquestion of fact in each case, rather than one of law - see Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream\nCo v Gutman [1976] FSR 545, 547-548 and Maxim\u2019s Ltd v Dye [1977] 1 WLR 1155,\n1159, 1162. Megarry V-C in Metric Resources Corporation v Leasemetrix Ltd\n[1979] FSR 571, 579 also expressed some doubt about Lord Diplock\u2019s view on this\npoint. And Lord Diplock\u2019s analysis was described as not being \u201can exactly accurate\nrendering of what was said in Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller's Margarine\u201d\nby Lloyd LJ (with whom Jacob and Stanley Burnton LJJ agreed) in Hotel Cipriani\nSrl v Cipriani (Grosvenor Street) Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 110, [2010] RPC 485, para\n99, although Lloyd LJ clearly considered that the actual decision in Star Industrial\nwas correct. As he concluded, however, in para 106, Anheuser-Busch was binding\nauthority \u201cfor the proposition that an undertaking which seeks to establish goodwill\nin relation to a mark for goods cannot do so, however great may be the reputation of\nhis mark in the UK, unless it has customers among the general public in the UK for\nthose products\u201d.\n32. So far as Anheuser-Busch is concerned, as I have already indicated, the fact\nthat the decision proceeded on the basis that a plaintiff in a passing off action must\nhave goodwill, in the form of customers, in the jurisdiction did not represent any\ndeparture from an approach already approved by the House of Lords. As Oliver LJ\npointed out at p 464, Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink at p 744 stated that a plaintiff\nmust have \u201cused the descriptive term long enough on the market in connection with\nhis own goods and have traded successfully enough to have built up a goodwill for\nhis business\u201d, and, as Oliver LJ then observed, this \u201cemphasises the point that\ngoodwill (as opposed to mere reputation) does not exist here apart from a business\ncarried on here\u201d. As Oliver LJ went on to say, the same feature \u201cemerges with even\ngreater clarity from the decision of the Privy Council in Star Industrial\u201d. And Dillon\nLJ in Anheuser-Busch at pp 475-476 cited Spalding, Star Industrial and Inland\nRevenue Commissioners v Muller to make the same point.\nPage 11\n33. A number of first instance, mostly interlocutory, cases were cited by Mr\nSilverleaf to support his argument that there is or should be no requirement that a\nclaimant in a passing off action should be able to establish goodwill, as opposed to\nmere reputation, in the jurisdiction concerned. I do not think that any of the decisions\nin question assists PCCM.\n34. In La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Anciens \u00c9tablissements Panhard et Levassor v\nPanhard Levassor Motor Company Ltd [1901] 2 Ch 513, it is true that the French\nmotor car manufacturer plaintiffs, as Farwell J put it at p 516, \u201cdid not sell directly\nin England\u201d. However, as he went on to explain, \u201ctheir cars were brought and\nimported into England, \u2026 so that England was one of their markets\u201d. As Dillon LJ\nput it in Anheuser-Busch at pp 477-478, \u201cthe French plaintiffs there had a market\nfor their cars with the general public in this country through the importers who had\nobtained licences from the third parties who had relevant patent rights and \u2026 the\nreputation, when the cars were imported into this country, enured to the French\nplaintiffs\u201d. Nor does Sheraton help PCCM. As explained in para 29 above, the US\nhotel company had a booking office and agents in London, so it had customers in\nEngland. In Suhner & Co AG v Suhner Ltd [1967] RPC 336, Plowman J made no\nconclusive finding that the plaintiff had goodwill in the UK, but it is clear that its\ngoods had been sold here - see at pp 337-338. In Globelegance BV v Sarkissian\n[1974] RPC 603, Templeman J reviewed many of the authorities at pp 609-613, and\nclearly accepted that it was necessary to have custom in this country, concluding\nthat \u201c[p]ure advertisement is clearly insufficient [but taking] bookings [is] sufficient\n[as is] carrying out orders in this country\u201d. He then decided that the activities of the\nplaintiff in that case, selling patterns to a department store, who then used the\npatterns to make up dresses which were sold under the plaintiff\u2019s mark, was enough.\n35. In a significant number of other cases at first instance, it is clear that, well\nbefore the Court of Appeal decision in Anheuser-Busch, Chancery Judges\nconsidered that a plaintiff had to establish at least an arguable case that it had\nbusiness in the UK before it could obtain an interlocutory injunction against passing\noff. Before turning to them, it is instructive to refer to Maxwell v Hogg (1867) LR 2\nCh 307, which appears to have been the first case in which an English court\nspecifically decided that mere reputation, without customers, was not enough to\nfound a passing off claim. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff\u2019s advertising\ncampaign in respect of a proposed new newspaper called \u201cBelgravia\u201d with a view\nto imminent publication did not give him any right to enjoin the defendant from\npublishing a newspaper with the same name. Turner LJ, after mentioning the\ninconvenience of a plaintiff who had not even used the mark being able to restrain\nsomeone else from doing so, said at p 312 that the plaintiff had \u201cneither given, nor\ncome under any obligation to give, anything to the world; so that there is a total want\nof consideration for the right which he claims\u201d. Cairns LJ at pp 313-314, explained\nthat the plaintiff had no \u201cright of property\u201d for which he could claim protection, as\nPage 12\n\u201cthere has been no sale, or offering for sale, of the articles to which the name is to\nbe attached\u201d.\n36. More recent cases which support Sky\u2019s case include the decisions of\nPennycuick J in Alain Bernardin et Cie v Pavilion Properties Ltd [1967] RPC 581,\nBrightman J in Amway Corporation v Eurway International Ltd [1974] RPC 82, and\nWalton J in Athlete\u2019s Foot Marketing Associates Inc v Cobra Sports Ltd [1980] RPC\n343. In Alain Bernardin, Pennycuick J held that the plaintiffs could not obtain an\ninjunction against the use of the mark CRAZY HORSE in the UK, even though they\ncould establish a reputation here for its cabaret in Paris under that name. The\nplaintiff\u2019s problem was that they could not identify any business done in the UK,\neither directly or indirectly (to use Farwell J\u2019s expression in Panhard), in connection\nwith their \u201cCrazy Horse Saloon\u201d in Paris, and the mere distribution of\nadvertisements was not enough (hence Templeman J\u2019s observation in Globelegance\n[1974] RPC 603). In other words, there does not seem to have been any evidence of\nany customers in England of the plaintiffs\u2019 Paris establishment as opposed to people\nin England who visited that establishment when they were in Paris (see at p 582).\n37. Mr Silverleaf pointed out that the reasoning of Pennycuick J caused Sir\nNicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C some concern in Pete Waterman Ltd v CBS United\nKingdom Ltd [1993] EMLR 27, 53-55. At pp 53-54, Sir Nicolas said that Pennycuick\nJ\u2019s reasoning was based on the proposition that \u201ceven if the foreign trader has\ncustomers here he cannot protect his reputation unless he has conducted some\nbusiness here\u201d, whereas the Vice-Chancellor thought that the law was or should be\nthat \u201c[i]f there is a use by the foreign trader in this country of his name for the\npurposes of his trade, the piracy of that name is an actionable wrong\u201d. But, as Mr\nHobbs pointed out, the decision in Alain Bernardin would have been the same if the\ntest identified by the Vice-Chancellor had been applied.\n38. Turning now to the cases in other jurisdictions, PCCM contends that\ndecisions of the courts of Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa,\nHong Kong and Singapore are consistent with its argument that a claimant does not\nhave to establish goodwill, in the sense of actual customers, within the jurisdiction,\nin order to establish a claim for passing off.\n39. In C&A Modes v C&A (Waterford) Ltd [1978] FSR 126, the Supreme Court\nof Ireland held that the plaintiff\u2019s C&A department store in Belfast was entitled to\nmount a claim in passing off in the Irish Republic. At p 139, Henchy J was clearly\nunhappy about the decision in Alain Bernardin, and said that there were in the Irish\nRepublic \u201csufficient customers of [the] plaintiff\u2019s business [in Belfast] to justify his\nclaim\u201d. At pp 140-141, Kenny J rejected the argument that a passing off claim\n\u2018should be limited to cases where the plaintiff had acquired some of its goodwill in\nthe Republic by user or trading in this country\u2019, and pointed out that the plaintiff in\nPage 13\nthat case had customers in the Republic, where it had \u201ccarried out extensive\nadvertising on television and radio and in the newspapers\u201d. He also said that the\ndecision in Alain Bernardin was wrong. O\u2019Higgins CJ agreed with Henchy J. I do\nnot find this decision of much assistance in this case. As Walton J said in Athlete\u2019s\nFoot at p 356, these judgments (at least arguably in the same way as the judgment\nin Pete Waterman) show a \u201cmisapprehension\u201d of the reasoning in Alain Bernardin:\n\u201cif there had been customers of the Crazy Horse business in England, in the sense\nin which there were customers of the Sheraton Hotels business in England, the\ndecision in [Alain Bernardin] surely must have been the other way\u201d.\n40. The Canadian case relied on by PCCM, Orkin Exterminating Co Inc v Pestco\nCo of Canada Ltd (1985) 19 DLR (4th) 90, is of no assistance. Although the\nplaintiff\u2019s business was conducted in the USA, it enjoyed thousands of Canadian\nclients who used its pest control services for their properties in Canada. At p 101 of\nhis judgment in the Court of Appeal in Ontario, Morden JA specifically relied on\nthe fact that the plaintiff had goodwill \u201cincluding having customers\u201d in Canada,\nalthough he did express disquiet about Lord Diplock\u2019s notion in Star Industrial that\ngoodwill had to be divided up nationally.\n41. The New Zealand decision referred to by PCCM, Dominion Rent A Car Ltd\nv Budget Rent A Car Systems (1970) Ltd [1987] 2 TCLR 91, does not take matters\nmuch further. The ultimate decision was that both parties were entitled to use the\nname BUDGET in connection with their respective car hire businesses in New\nZealand, and that turned on the facts. At p 101, Cooke P said that he did not think\nthat Lord Diplock in Star Industrial should be understood as saying that goodwill\nshould be automatically divisible between jurisdictions, describing it as\n\u201cunnecessarily myopic to restrict this process to national boundaries\u201d. The furthest\nCooke P went in the direction PCCM argues for was at pp 101-102, where he said\nthat he thought that \u201can Australian company\u2019s reputation and goodwill can extend\nto New Zealand (and vice versa)\u201d, but, importantly, he added \u201cand, at least if there\nis a sufficient business connection with this country, will be entitled to protection\nhere\u201d. At pp 106-107, he said that \u201cthe rental vehicle business in Australasia cannot\nbe divided into two mutually exclusive groups of customers, those who hire vehicles\nfor driving in Australia and those who hire vehicles for driving in New Zealand.\nObviously the same persons may do both\u201d, thereby rejecting the contention that the\ndefendant only had customers in New Zealand and the plaintiff in Australia. In his\njudgment, Somers J said at p 116 that a plaintiff in a passing off action \u201cmust show\nan invasion of that intangible right of property compendiously described as goodwill\nwhich can only exist in New Zealand when attached to a business having some\nconnection with this country\u201d. At p 120, Casey J quoted with apparent approval the\nview of Lord Fraser in Erven Warnink. Richardson J was \u201cin general agreement\u201d\nwith Cooke P and Somers J, and McMullin J was \u201cin general agreement\u201d with Cooke\nP.\nPage 14\n42. Support for PCCM\u2019s case may however be found in the decision of the\nFederal Court of Australia in ConAgra Inc v McCain Foods (Aust) Pty Ltd (1992)\n106 ALR 465, given by Lockhart J, with whom Gummow and French JJ agreed (and\ngave judgments of their own). After a very full review of the common law authorities\n(including those I have discussed above) on pp 473-501, Lockhart J said at p 504\nthat it was \u201cno longer valid, if it ever was, to speak of a business having goodwill or\nreputation only where the business is carried on\u201d, relying on \u201c[m]odern mass\nadvertising \u2026 [which] reaches people in many countries of the world\u201d, \u201c[t]he\ninternational mobility of the world population\u201d and the fact that \u201c[t]his is an age of\nenormous commercial enterprises\u201d. He also said at p 505 that, in his view, \u201cthe \u2018hard\nline\u2019 cases in England conflict with the needs of contemporary business and\ninternational commerce\u201d. He concluded on the next page that \u201cit is not necessary \u2026\nthat a plaintiff, in order to maintain a passing off action, must have a place of\nbusiness or a business presence in Australia; nor is it necessary that his goods are\nsold here\u201d, saying that it would be \u201csufficient if his goods have a reputation in this\ncountry among persons here, whether residents or otherwise\u201d. Two points should be\nnoted about this decision. First, the passing off claim nonetheless failed because the\nplaintiff was held to have an insufficient reputation in Australia. Secondly, the High\nCourt of Australia has not considered this issue.\n43. The approach of the Supreme Court of South Africa in Caterham Car Sales\n& Coachworks Ltd v Birkin Cars (Pty) Ltd [1998] 3 All SA 175 (A) is to similar\neffect \u2013 see at para 16. Indeed, at para 19, ConAgra was cited with approval.\nHowever, once again, the claim failed on the ground of insufficiency of reputation.\n44. As to Hong Kong, PCCM points out that, in Ten-Ichi Co Ltd v Jancar Ltd\n[1989] 2 HKC 330, Sears J in the High Court on an application for an interlocutory\ninjunction seems to have held that mere reputation was enough to found a passing\noff claim following an earlier Hong Kong High Court decision. However, more\nrecently, the Court of Final Appeal in In re Ping An Securities Ltd (2009) 12\nHKCFAR 808, para 17, cited Lord Oliver in Reckitt & Colman to support the\n(admittedly undisputed) proposition that a plaintiff \u201cmust establish a goodwill (in\nthe country or region) in a business in the supply of goods or services\u201d under the\nrelevant get-up in order to maintain a claim in passing off.\n45. Finally, Singapore. In Jet Aviation (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jet Maintenance\nPte Ltd [1998] 3 SLR(R) 713, para 45, PCCM contends that Warren LH Khoo J in\nthe High Court appears to have followed ConAgra. I am not at all sure that he did:\nsee at para 42. However, it is unnecessary to decide that question, because more\nrecently, the Court of Appeal considered the issue in an impressively wide-ranging\njudgment in Staywell Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Starwood Hotels & Resorts\nWorldwide Inc [2013] SGCA 65, [2014] 1 SLR 911. After briefly considering most\nof the authorities to which I have referred (including the decision of Arnold J in this\ncase), Sundaresh Menon CJ, giving the judgment of the court, explained at para 135\nPage 15\nthat the Singapore courts had \u201clargely followed Star Industrial, holding that a\nforeign trader which does not conduct any business activity in Singapore cannot\nmaintain an action in passing off here\u201d, and that this \u201cdraws a clear distinction\nbetween goodwill and reputation\u201d.\n46. However, as he explained in the next paragraph, this \u201chard line\u201d approach\nhas been softened in one respect in Singapore (citing CDL Hotels International Ltd\nv Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd [1998] 1 SLR(R) 975, para 58) namely where the plaintiff\nhas started \u201cpre-business activities\u201d, such as \u201cembark[ing] on massive advertising\ncampaigns before the commencement of trading to familiarise the public with the\nservice or product\u201d. Sundaresh Menon CJ explained at para 138 that this was\nconsistent with two English decisions, WH Allen & Co v Brown Watson Ltd [1965]\nRPC 191 and British Broadcasting Corporation v Talbot Motor Co Ltd [1981] FSR\n228, a view which derives some support from the judgment of Dillon LJ in Marcus\nPublishing plc v Hutton-Wild Communications Ltd [1990] RPC 576, 584.\nDiscussion\n47. Although I acknowledge that PCCM\u2019s case is not without force (as is well\ndemonstrated by the reasoning in the judgments in ConAgra), I have reached the\nconclusion that this appeal should be dismissed on the same ground on which it was\ndecided in the courts below. In other words, I consider that we should reaffirm that\nthe law is that a claimant in a passing off claim must establish that it has actual\ngoodwill in this jurisdiction, and that such goodwill involves the presence of clients\nor customers in the jurisdiction for the products or services in question. And, where\nthe claimant\u2019s business is abroad, people who are in the jurisdiction, but who are not\ncustomers of the claimant in the jurisdiction, will not do, even if they are customers\nof the claimant when they go abroad.\n48. It seems to have been the consistent view of the House of Lords and Privy\nCouncil from 1915 to 1990 that a plaintiff who seeks passing off relief in an English\ncourt must show that he has goodwill, in the form of customers, in the jurisdiction\nof the court. While it can be said that, in none of the cases discussed in paras 21-25\nabove was that point the main focus of attention, it nonetheless seems clear that that\nis what a succession of respected judges, many of whom had substantial experience\nin this area, considered to be the law. That conclusion is underlined by the reasoning\nand conclusion in the judgments in Anheuser-Busch, and indeed the first instance\njudgments discussed in paras 32-36 above.\n49. It is of course open to this court to develop or even to change the law in\nrelation to a common law principle, when it has become archaic or unsuited to\ncurrent practices or beliefs. Indeed it is one of the great virtues of the common law\nPage 16\nthat it can adapt itself to practical and commercial realities, which is particularly\nimportant in a world which is fast changing in terms of electronic processes, travel\nand societal values. Nonetheless, we should bear in mind that changing the common\nlaw sometimes risks undermining legal certainty, both because a change in itself can\nsometimes generate uncertainty and because change can sometimes lead to other\nactual or suggested consequential changes.\n50. In addition to domestic cases, it is both important and helpful to consider how\nthe law has developed in other common law jurisdictions \u2013 important because it is\ndesirable that the common law jurisdictions have a consistent approach, and helpful\nbecause every national common law judiciary can benefit from the experiences and\nthoughts of other common law judges. In the present instance, the Singapore courts\nfollow the approach of the UK courts, whereas the courts of Australia (subject to the\nHigh Court holding otherwise) and South Africa seem to favour the approach\nsupported by PCCM. The position is less clear in other Commonwealth\njurisdictions. In the United States of America, the approach appears to be consistent\nwith that of the courts below in this case. Thus in Grupo Gigante SA De CV v Dallo\n& Co Inc (2004) 391 F 3d 1088 the Court of Appeals for the 9th circuit said at p 1093\nthat \u201cpriority of trademark rights in the United States depends solely upon priority\nof use in the United States, not on priority of use anywhere in the world. Earlier use\nin another country usually just does not count\u201d. Accordingly it does not appear to\nme that there is anything like a clear trend in the common law courts outside the UK\naway from the \u201chard line\u201d approach manifested in the UK cases discussed in paras\n21-26 and 32-36 above.\n51. Particularly in the light of what has been said in some of the cases discussed\nabove, it appears that there are two connected issues which justify further discussion,\nnamely (i) clarification as to what constitutes sufficient business to give rise to\ngoodwill as a matter of principle, and (ii) resolution of the judicial disagreement as\nto the jurisdictional division of goodwill described by Lord Diplock in Star\nIndustrial.\n52. As to what amounts to a sufficient business to amount to goodwill, it seems\nclear that mere reputation is not enough, as the cases cited in paras 21-26 and 32-36\nabove establish. The claimant must show that it has a significant goodwill, in the\nform of customers, in the jurisdiction, but it is not necessary that the claimant\nactually has an establishment or office in this country. In order to establish goodwill,\nthe claimant must have customers within the jurisdiction, as opposed to people in\nthe jurisdiction who happen to be customers elsewhere. Thus, where the claimant\u2019s\nbusiness is carried on abroad, it is not enough for a claimant to show that there are\npeople in this jurisdiction who happen to be its customers when they are abroad.\nHowever, it could be enough if the claimant could show that there were people in\nthis jurisdiction who, by booking with, or purchasing from, an entity in this country,\nobtained the right to receive the claimant\u2019s service abroad. And, in such a case, the\nPage 17\nentity need not be a part or branch of the claimant: it can be someone acting for or\non behalf of the claimant. That is why, as explained in Athlete\u2019s Foot, the decision\nin Panhard et Levassor and the observations in Pete Waterman are compatible with\nthe decision in Alain Bernardin.\n53. As to Lord Diplock\u2019s statement in Star Industrial that, for the purpose of\ndetermining whether a claimant in a passing off action can establish the first of Lord\nOliver\u2019s three elements, an English court has to consider whether the claimant can\nestablish goodwill in England, I consider that it was correct. In other words, when\nconsidering whether to give protection to a claimant seeking relief for passing off,\nthe court must be satisfied that the claimant\u2019s business has goodwill within its\njurisdiction.\n54. It would be wrong to suggest that there is a rule of law that, whatever the\npoint at issue, goodwill has to be divided between jurisdictions, not least because\n(unsurprisingly) we have not had an exhaustive analysis of all the circumstances in\nwhich goodwill may have to be considered by the court. However, it seems to me\nthat, when it comes to a domestic, common law issue such as passing off, an English\ncourt has to consider the factual position in the UK. That is well illustrated by the\nfact that, even if PCCM\u2019s argument was accepted and it was enough for a claimant\nmerely to establish a reputation, that reputation would still have to be within the\njurisdiction.\n55. The notion that goodwill in the context of passing off is territorial in nature\nis also supported by refusal of judges to accept that a court of one jurisdiction has\npower to make orders in relation to the goodwill in another jurisdiction. I have in\nmind the decisions of the House of Lords in Lecouturier v Rey [1910] AC 262, 265\nper Lord Macnaghten, with whom Lord Atkinson and Lord Collins agreed, and at\npp 269-272 per Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, and the Privy Council in Ingenohl v\nWing On & Co (Shanghai) Ltd (1927) 44 RPC 343, 359-360, per Viscount Haldane\ngiving the advice of the Board. The territorial approach to goodwill is also apparent\nin the context of trade marks in RJ Reuter Co Ltd v Mulhens [1954] Ch 50, 89 and\n95-96 (per Lord Evershed MR and Romer LJ respectively) and Adrema Werke\nMaschinenbau GmbH v Custodian of Enemy Property [1957] RPC 49, 54-55 and 59\n(per Lord Evershed MR and Jenkins LJ). It is also worth mentioning that article 6\nof the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property 1883 (last revised\n1967 and last amended 1979) states, in para (1) that \u201cregistration of trademarks shall\nbe determined in each country \u2026 by its domestic legislation\u201d, and in para (3) that a\nduly registered mark is to be \u201cregarded as independent of marks registered in other\ncountries of the Union\u201d.\n56. My view on the two issues discussed in paras 49-53 above is supported by a\nbrief extract from Lord Fraser\u2019s speech in Erven Warnink at p 755, where he said\nPage 18\nthat \u201cthe meaning of the name in \u2026 countries other than England is immaterial\nbecause what the court is concerned to do is to protect the plaintiffs' property in the\ngoodwill attaching to the name in England and it has nothing to do with the\nreputation or meaning of the name elsewhere\u201d.\n57. Indirect support for this approach is also to be found in decisions of the Court\nof Justice of the European Union, which has emphasised in a number of decisions\nthe need for \u201cgenuine use\u201d of a mark, namely \u201cto guarantee the identity of the origin\nof the goods or services for which it is registered, in order to create or preserve an\noutlet for those goods or services\u201d, and that this means \u201creal commercial exploitation\nof the mark in the course of trade, particularly the usages regarded as warranted in\nthe economic sector concerned as a means of maintaining or creating market share\nfor the goods or services protected by the mark\u201d \u2013 to quote from Leno Merken BV v\nHagelkruis Beheer BV (Case C-149/11) EU:C:2012:816, para 29. Further, it is\nrelevant to note that the CJEU has also held that \u201cthe mere fact that a website\n[advertising or selling the product or service concerned] is accessible from the\nterritory covered by the trade mark is not a sufficient basis for concluding that the\noffers for sale displayed there are targeted at consumers in that territory\u201d \u2013 L'Oreal\nSA v eBay International AG (Case C-324/09) EU:C:2011:474 [2011] ECR I-6011,\npara 64.\n58. It is also of interest that, even in the context of the single market, the CJEU\nhas accepted that \u201cbecause of linguistic, cultural, social and economic differences\nbetween the Member States, a sign which is devoid of distinctive character or\ndescriptive of the goods or services concerned in one Member State is not so in\nanother Member State\u201d \u2013 see Junited Autoglas Deutschland GmBH & Co KG v\nOffice for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) (Case\nT-297/13) EU:T:2014:893, para 31, citing Matratzen Concord AG v Hukla Germany\nSA (Case C-421/04) EU:C:2006:164 [2006] ECR I-2303, para 25.\n59. Professor Wadlow has, in my judgment, correctly summarised the position\nin The Law of Passing-off - Unfair Competition by Misrepresentation 4\nth ed, 2011,\npara 3-131:\n\u201cThe reason why goodwill is territorial is that it is a legal proprietary\nright, existing or not in any jurisdiction according to whether the laws\nof that jurisdiction protect its putative owner. Goodwill in the legal\nsense is therefore something more than bare reputation \u2026. The\ndistinction between goodwill in the legal sense and reputation in the\neveryday sense is like that between copyright and the underlying\nliterary work. It may be surprising, and even inconvenient, that at the\nmoment a literary work is reduced to writing tens or hundreds of\nlegally distinct copyrights may simultaneously come into existence all\nPage 19\nover the world, but the nature of copyright as a legal right of property\narising in any given jurisdiction from national legislation, common\nlaw or self-executing treaty means that it must be wrong to speak as if\nthere were a single international copyright.\u201d\n60. This analysis can be said with some justification to involve some fine\ndistinctions, and on some occasions to lead to some difficult questions of fact and to\nresult in some decisions which could appear rather harsh. However, any decision as\nto what a claimant must show in order to establish the first element of Lord Oliver\u2019s\ntrilogy of elements or requirements will involve fine distinctions, and will\nsometimes involve difficult or harsh cases. I am unconvinced that if we accept the\nconclusion of the courts below, supported by Sky, it would be likely to lead to more\narguable unfairnesses or difficulties than if we adopted PCCM\u2019s case.\n61. It is also necessary to bear in mind the balancing exercise underlying the law\nof passing off, which Somers J described in Dominion Rent A Car at p 116 as \u201ca\ncompromise between two conflicting objectives, on the one hand the public interest\nin free competition, on the other the protection of a trader against unfair competition\nby others\u201d. More broadly, there is always a temptation to conclude that, whenever a\ndefendant has copied the claimant\u2019s mark or get-up, and therefore will have\nbenefitted from the claimant\u2019s inventiveness, expenditure or hard work, the claimant\nought to have a cause of action against the defendant. Apart from the rather narrower\npoint that passing off must involve detriment to the claimant, it is not enough for a\nclaimant to establish copying to succeed. All developments, whether in the\ncommercial, artistic, professional or scientific fields, are made on the back of other\npeople\u2019s ideas: copying may often be an essential step to progress. Hence, there has\nto be some balance achieved between the public interest in not unduly hindering\ncompetition and encouraging development, on the one hand, and on the other, the\npublic interest in encouraging, by rewarding through a monopoly, originality, effort\nand expenditure \u2013 the argument which is reflected in Turner LJ\u2019s observation at p\n312 in Maxwell v Hogg to the effect that a plaintiff who has merely advertised, but\nnot marketed, his product, has given no consideration to the public in return for his\nclaimed monopoly. In the instant case, the assessment of the appropriate balance\nbetween competition and protection, which arises in relation to any intellectual\nproperty right, must be made by the court, given that passing off is a common law\nconcept.\n62. If it was enough for a claimant merely to establish reputation within the\njurisdiction to maintain a passing off action, it appears to me that it would tip the\nbalance too much in favour of protection. It would mean that, without having any\nbusiness or any consumers for its product or service in this jurisdiction, a claimant\ncould prevent another person using a mark, such as an ordinary English word,\n\u201cnow\u201d, for a potentially indefinite period in relation to a similar product or service.\nIn my view, a claimant who has simply obtained a reputation for its mark in this\nPage 20\njurisdiction in respect of his products or services outside this jurisdiction has not\ndone enough to justify granting him an effective monopoly in respect of that mark\nwithin the jurisdiction.\n63. I am unpersuaded that PCCM\u2019s case is strengthened by the fact that we are\nnow in the age of easy worldwide travel and global electronic communication. While\nI accept that there is force in the point that the internet can be said to render the\nnotion of a single international goodwill more attractive, it does not answer the\npoints made in paras 51-59 above. Further, given that it may now be so easy to\npenetrate into the minds of people almost anywhere in the world so as to be able to\nlay claim to some reputation within virtually every jurisdiction, it seems to me that\nthe imbalance between protection and competition which PCCM\u2019s case already\ninvolves (as described in paras 60-62 above) would be exacerbated. The same point\ncan be made in relation to increased travel: it renders it much more likely that\nconsumers of a claimant\u2019s product or service abroad will happen to be within this\njurisdiction and thus to recognise a mark as the claimant\u2019s. If PCCM\u2019s case were\ncorrect, it would mean that a claimant could shut off the use of a mark in this\njurisdiction even though it had no customers or business here, and had not spent any\ntime or money in developing a market here - and did not even intend to do so.\n64. A rather different factor which militates against PCCM\u2019s case is section 56\nof the Trade Marks Act 1994 which gives effect to article 6(bis) of the Paris\nConvention) and is concerned with \u201cwell-known marks\u201d. By virtue of subsection\n(1), section 56 applies to a mark which is owned by a person who is domiciled or\nhas a business in a Convention country and which is \u201cwell-known in the United\nKingdom\u201d. Section 56(2) entitles such a person to \u201crestrain by injunction the use in\nthe United Kingdom of a trade mark which, or the essential part of which, is identical\nor similar to his mark, in relation to identical or similar goods or services, where the\nuse is likely to cause confusion\u201d. This provision is significant in the present context\nbecause it substantially reduces the likelihood of the sort of harsh results referred to\nat the start of para 60 above. It means that, where a mark which is used abroad and\nhas a reputation in this country, it still can be protected if it satisfies section 56(1),\neven if the proprietor of the mark cannot establish any customers or sufficient\ngoodwill in this jurisdiction.\n65. A more radical argument was advanced by Sky based on section 56 of the\n1994 Act, namely that, by that section, the legislature decided on the circumstances\nin which mere reputation in this country should be enough to justify protection being\naccorded to a mark used in another country, and that the courts should not extend\nthe common law further than Parliament has thought it right to go. As Mr Hobbs put\nit, if Parliament has decided that domestic reputation is enough in the case of a \u201cwellknown\u201d mark, it is not for the courts to extend the principle to marks which are not\n\u201cwell-known\u201d. Another, perhaps starker, way of putting the point is that, if PCCM\u2019s\ncase is correct, it is hard to see what purpose section 56 of the 1994 Act would have.\nPage 21\nI see considerable force in that argument, but it is unnecessary to rule on it, and I\nprefer not to do so.\n66. Finally, a point which I would leave open is that discussed in the judgment\nof Sundaresh Menon CJ in Staywell (see para 46 above), namely whether a passing\noff claim can be brought by a claimant who has not yet attracted goodwill in the UK,\nbut has launched a substantial advertising campaign within the UK making it clear\nthat it will imminently be marketing its goods or services in the UK under the mark\nin question. It may be that such a conclusion would not so much be an exception, as\nan extension, to the \u201chard line\u201d, in that public advertising with an actual and\npublicised imminent intention to market, coupled with a reputation thereby\nestablished may be sufficient to generate a protectable goodwill. On any view, the\nconclusion would involve overruling Maxwell v Hogg, and, if it would be an\nexception rather than an extension to the \u201chard line\u201d, it would have to be justified\nby commercial fairness rather than principle. However, it is unnecessary to rule on\nthe point, which, as explained in para 46, has some limited support in this\njurisdiction and clear support in Singapore. Modern developments might seem to\nargue against such an exception (see para 63 above), but it may be said that it would\nbe cheap and easy, particularly for a large competitor, to \u201cspike\u201d a pre-marketing\nadvertising campaign in the age of the internet. It would, I think, be better to decide\nthe point in a case where it arises. Assuming that such an exception exists, I do not\nconsider that the existence of such a limited, pragmatic exception to the \u201chard line\u201d\ncould begin to justify the major and fundamental departure from the clear, wellestablished and realistic principles which PCCM\u2019s case would involve. In this case,\nPCCM\u2019s plans for extending its service into the UK under the NOW TV mark were\napparently pretty well advanced when Sky launched their NOW TV service, but the\nplans were still not in the public domain, and therefore, even if the exception to the\n\u201chard line\u201d is accepted, it would not assist PCCM.\nConclusion\n67. For these reasons, I conclude that PCCM\u2019s appeal should be dismissed. Its\nbusiness is based in Hong Kong, and it has no customers, and therefore no goodwill,\nin the UK. It is true that, according to the Judge, there are a significant number of\npeople who are, temporarily or in the longer term, members of the Chinese\ncommunity in the UK, with whom the mark NOW TV is associated with PCCM\u2019s\nIPTV service. In so far as they are customers of PCCM, they are customers in Hong\nKong, and not in the UK, because it is only in Hong Kong that they can enjoy the\nservice in question, and the service is not marketed, sold or offered in the UK. The\npeople in the UK who get access to PCCM\u2019s NOW TV programmes via the\nwebsites, or on various international airlines, are not PCCM customers at any rate\nin the UK, because there is no payment involved (either directly by the people\nconcerned or indirectly through third party advertising), and the availability of\nPCCM\u2019s product in these outlets simply was intended to, and did, promote PCCM\u2019s\nPage 22\nHong Kong business. Basically, it simply amounted to advertising in the UK, and,\nas explained above, a reputation acquired through advertising is not enough to found\na claim in passing off.\n68. Given that we are dismissing the appeal, it is unnecessary to consider Sky\u2019s\nother arguments to support this conclusion which were the same as those which it\nwould have raised before the Court of Appeal in its respondent\u2019s notice (see para 13\nabove). If we had allowed PCCM\u2019s appeal, because the Court of Appeal\nunderstandably did not address those issues we would have remitted the case to the\nCourt of Appeal to consider them.\n\n": "10 \n"}
